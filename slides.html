We will use a toy webpage to illustrate basic HTML and CSS [just to make sure we&#x27;re all on the same page :) ]<br/>
</p></aside></section>

Then we&#x27;ll glance at the conversation between your browser and each website you visit<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/08-30-16.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Before exploring how text on the page is styled<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-36-19.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
And finally we&#x27;ll intercept user mouse actions to make a real webpage more readable.<br/>
Let&#x27;s jump into that toy webpage...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-55-46.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Your browser gets HTML documents from the websites you visit, and &quot;renders&quot; that HTML into the webpages you see.<br/>
The HTML document is one big HTML &quot;element&quot;.  [try to use the terms &#x27;element&#x27; and &#x27;tag&#x27; consistently]<br/>
each element is marked by a start tag and end tag; elements can contain other elements; all visible elements go into the body.<br/>
The HTML element always contains a head element and a body element.  Here both are empty, so nothing is displayed below, until we add something to the body...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-55-53.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
We used to style content by embedding it in style elements like I=italic and b=bold.  But as website grew to many pages and began to merge with other sites,<br/>
it became costly to have styles scattered across every page, and the need to centralize style information became clear.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-01.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
So html5 introduced two new elements: div, for page divisions, which stack vertically, as paragraphs do; and span, for smaller page fragments, which stack horizontally, as words do.<br/>
Span has no intrinsic styling, as you see, so finally let&#x27;s add something to the head element.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-04.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
The HTML &quot;style&quot; element allows us to embed CSS, or style rules, into the HTML page, tho it could be in a totally separate file.<br/>
Each CSS rule has a selector and a property list that maps each property to its value.<br/>
In this rule we select all the span elements in the page, and set both the font-style and font-weight.<br/>
But to mimic our html3, we need a way to distinguish different span elements.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-07.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
So we add an &quot;attribute&quot; called &quot;class&quot; to the HTML elements, and CSS selectors that start with a dot to match elements of a certain class.<br/>
So for example elements of class &quot;site&quot; are bolded.<br/>
This is the &quot;separation of concerns&quot;: content in HTML, styles in CSS.<br/>
...now that we have matched the html3 in html5, we can drop the html3.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-10-render-droppedHtml3.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
(dropped html3)<br/>
but recall the point of this is to centralize styles, and so we can move the style rules to a file without affecting the rendered page.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-11-render-cssInFile.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
(css in file)<br/>
but we&#x27;ll keep the css here in the HTML for this demo.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-10-render-droppedHtml3.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Now CSS is declarative, meaning all the rules always apply, and it is possible for rules to conflict.<br/>
So let&#x27;s add back that element-wide span rule, just to show what happens when rules conflict.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-12.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
What will happen if we make the .org rule green?  Which rule wins?<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-14.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Any declarative system that can express conflicts needs a method to resolve those conflicts.<br/>
Specificity is that method for CSS.<br/>
&#x27;dot&#x27; or class rules are considered more specific than rules that apply to all occurrences of an element, so they win.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-17.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Note that the order of CSS rules doesn&#x27;t matter.  This is typical of declarative systems.  [can flip back and forth]<br/>
</p></aside></section>

Pre: all this HTML, but no hypertext!<br/>
To specify where to go when the user clicks, we need to put another HTML attribute somewhere to map the &quot;hypertext reference&quot; property to an actual url, or web link.<br/>
To make the sites into clickable links, we embed them in &#x27;a&#x27; [for anchor] elements, mapping the &#x27;href&#x27; [hypertext reference] to the site&#x27;s url [universal resource locator].<br/>
[click on wikipedia link and raise separator; then go back]<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-56-21.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Pre: before we leave this toy page, note that HTML is a markup language, in which every element&#x27;s start and end is marked, so all this indentation that is so very readable to us is useless for the browser.<br/>
And indeed, removing it makes no difference in the rendered page.<br/>
The structure of a markup document can be deduced, regardless of its formatting,<br/>
and this is closer to what HTML looks like in the wild.<br/>
Now let&#x27;s look at some real web pages!<br/>

</section><section><img data-src="images/07-58-39.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
If I right-click anywhere on the page I get a menu.<br/>
&quot;View page source&quot; is an old option that shows us that raw unindented HTML (ask me later),<br/>
whereas &quot;Inspect&quot; gives us an amazing set of tools...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/07-59-32.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
This opens the devtools, or developer tools, interface, specifically the Elements tab,<br/>
where we can easily collapse the body to see the essential structure of the page.<br/>
I feel like a kid in a candy shop, there&#x27;s way too much to show you everything here,<br/>
but before I show you how the page is styled, I gotta show you this one thing!<br/>

[css box model]<br/>
here we see that the element is in blue, its border [of zero thickness, thus invisible] is in yellow, and the element is separated by 7pixels of padding on the right, and some margin as well.<br/>
Think of the element as being packed in a box called the border, separated from the box on the inside by padding, and separated from any adjacent boxes by margin.  This is the &quot;CSS box model&quot;<br/>
(go back to the top of the style pane)<br/>
</p></aside></section>
</section><section><img data-src="images/08-30-16.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
At the first class rule,<br/>
we see the font-weight is 600, which out of 900 is pretty bold.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/08-30-35.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
We can turn off that style to unbold the text.<br/>
Note that we are changing the styling for all elements of this class,<br/>
so &quot;Owner:&quot; etc are also unbolded.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/08-31-16.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
We can turn that rule back on<br/>
and increase its value to 900<br/>
to further bold-ify the matched elements.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/08-31-58.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
And we can animate the padding with the mousewheel or arrow keys,<br/>
here modified by the alt key to go by tenths,<br/>
as the tooltip helpfully explains.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/08-32-36.png">

<section><img data-src="images/09-06-55.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
And lose our black color!  Oops what happened? [dont dismiss the picker else cannot reset]<br/>
note that before [reset to demo, either by ctrl-Z or copy/pasting the color]<br/>
the alpha [ie opacity or opaqueness, the opposite of transparency] was 1,<br/>
whereas now it&#x27;s zero [to let the background image show thru].<br/>
Yes, in CSS we can actually specify a totally transparent color--which can be useful for making something disappear.<br/>
But we can just set alpha to one...and now we&#x27;re more compatible with the surrounding color scheme.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-07-46.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
But it&#x27;s a shame to completely hide the background image.<br/>
Let&#x27;s explore how readable the text would be at middle levels of opacity<br/>
(could use alt-mousewheel, but use slider so folks can see)<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-07-57.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Anywhere around 0.5 works for me.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-08-18.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Readability much enhanced!  Now let&#x27;s see how we could do this with javascript.<br/>
We turn off the background styles and note the &quot;s-info-box&quot; class,<br/>
which we&#x27;ll need in javascript to select these &quot;info boxes&quot;,<br/>
as well as the rgb numbers we want to set the background to...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-10-16.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
And switch to the console tab, which is a javascript console [ie conversation].<br/>
We will use a popular javascript library called jquery because it will let us move faster.<br/>
A library is just a layer of added functionality; the language is still javascript.<br/>
First we verify that jquery is loaded.  As soon as we type &#x27;j&#x27;, it autocompletes...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-js1.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
And hitting enter, we see that jQuery is a function,<br/>
which we&#x27;ll return to.  But is everything a function?<br/>
What would happen if we enter something random?<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-js2.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
We see the error &quot;...is not defined&quot;. <br/>
OK so jQuery is already defined,<br/>
loaded by one of the many script elements on the page.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-js3.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
JQuery assigns the dollar sign as a synonym for the jQuery function, just to save typing.<br/>
You see it gives the exact same function.<br/>
(hit spacebar to decline any autocomplete after the $ character)<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-selectBoxes1.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
To call the jQuery function, or any function, we write its name followed by any inputs in parens.<br/>
The jQuery function takes any CSS selector as input, allowing us to specify any elements on the page just as we did in CSS.  So let&#x27;s try that...<br/>
But javascript doesnt like it.  That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a CSS selector, and javascript knows nothing about CSS--<br/>
that separation_of_concerns again!  The browser&#x27;s CSS &quot;engine&quot; is separate from its js engine.<br/>
So we need a way to tell js &quot;dont try to make sense of this, just give it to CSS&quot; which we do by quoting it.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-selectBoxes2.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
The jQuery function now &quot;returns&quot; to us a list of elements from the CSS engine.<br/>
(why not 4?  Scroll slightly down to see the others)<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-selectBoxes3.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
We can expand the return value to see all the elements (they&#x27;re all divs) and mouseover to see them highlighted.<br/>
Note that they&#x27;re numbered from zero (explaining why is not simple, sorry!  But most languages do this)<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-selectBoxes4.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
For example mouseover-ing element 2 highlights the third box<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-selectBoxes5.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
So to choose the third box, we up-arrow and append &quot;[2]&quot;<br/>
(near bottom of screen yet?  Ensure everyone can see, else move devtools to its own window in the top half of the screen; no need to see the entire height of the divs)<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-selectBoxes6.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Let&#x27;s save ourselves some typing by giving that third box element a name: box3.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api1.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
To see the functions we can call on this js &quot;object&quot;, we add a dot,<br/>
and devtools autocomplete then offers lots of function-ality via functions...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api2.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
But we want a css function, which isnt in the list.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api3.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
And if we simply insist, we see it is undefined.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api4.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
But by passing our box3 element object to jQuery, we get many more functions,<br/>
including css...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api5.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Which we see has lots of code, but we dont need to understand that,<br/>
all we need to do is call the function and pass in the inputs...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api6.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
With no inputs, javascript complains that it &quot;Cannot read properties of undefined&quot; so we see it&#x27;s trying to read css properties from the input, and a missing input is &quot;undefined&quot;.<br/>
so cool!  Every error is like an xray of a small fragment of the underlying library, giving us a clue about its structure.  That call stack starts at the bottom with our code--you can see we got five layers down into jquery.<br/>
Now it just happens that javascript objects look almost the same as css property lists.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api7.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
So giving an empty property list silences the error,<br/>
tho of course it does no styling.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api8.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Giving a property gets us a new error, but note, by comparing the call stacks, that this time we didnt get deep into jQuery, and in fact not at all into jQuery.<br/>
Instead, javascript complains that it doesnt know &#x27;black&#x27;, which of course we&#x27;ve seen before--[brief pause here]<br/>
it&#x27;s that separation_of_concerns again!  Javascript doesnt know CSS colors, so what do we do?  [pause]<br/>
we quote &#x27;black&#x27;.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-api9.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
And that works!<br/>
We dont need to quote &#x27;background&#x27; cuz javascript considers all object keys as quoted.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><section>skipping: reinforce separation_of_concerns<aside class="notes"><p>arrow down to see skipped slides</p></aside></section><section><img data-src="images/09-26-04.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
[reinforce separation_of_concerns]<br/>
of course we dont really want black, that was just to get oriented...<br/>
And of course javascript doesnt know rgb [separation_of_concerns!]<br/>
so we must quote it...<br/>
</p></aside></section>
</section><section><img data-src="images/slide-apiA.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
And quoting the rgb expression works!<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-apiM.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
But wow, let&#x27;s look at what we did.  We selected the elements with a certain class, then selected the third one,<br/>
then passed that element to the jQuery function to enhance its API, and finally called its css function.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-apiN.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Without box3, we get this ugly expression, which does the same thing [using full opacity to see the effect].<br/>
Pretty ugly in raw form [especially at start of line], but easy to think about because of the name, or &quot;alias&quot;, we gave to box3.<br/>
That the power of aliasing--naming intermediate values, a form of abstraction that lets us express complexity readably, step-by-step.<br/>
Let&#x27;s restore our previous state [via up-arrow twice].<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-apiO.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Now how can we do that for all four boxes?  We could literally do this four times, but hey, we&#x27;re coding, and coding is all about automation.  <br/>
But javascript is imperative [not declarative like CSS], so the code executes immediately, and then it&#x27;s done, burnt out as it we&#x27;re.<br/>
We need a way to freeze code in a form that can be reused without burning out, on a different element each time, so it needs a slot for the element.<br/>
And that&#x27;s exactly what functions are.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><section>skipping: function with inputs<aside class="notes"><p>arrow down to see skipped slides</p></aside></section><section><img data-src="images/09-36-04.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
[function with inputs]<br/>
functions name their inputs in parentheses and list their code in braces.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-36-19.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
[function with inputs]<br/>
so we can write a function that takes an element as input, passes it to jQuery to enhance functionality, and calls the css function.<br/>
It doesnt matter how we name &#x27;element&#x27; as long as they match.  (assign the function name as the last typing you do)<br/>
and since this is a function that changes the background color and alpha, we&#x27;ll call it...zap  : )<br/>
(rgb colors changed, oops!)<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-39-12.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
[function with inputs]<br/>
we can zap box3...recalling what box3 is, we can also zap the first box.<br/>
(our zap function returns nothing, thus the &#x27;undefined&#x27; after each call--if we wanted, we could return element or $(element))<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-44-12.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
[function with inputs]<br/>
OK now we&#x27;ve frozen our code into a reusable package, that is, a function,<br/>
so we&#x27;re ready to use the jQuery &#x27;each&#x27; function, which takes a function as its input,<br/>
and calls that function for &#x27;each&#x27; element matching the CSS selector.<br/>
So far we have called jquery functions, but jquery each() will call our function.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-44-37.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
[function with inputs]<br/>
but when we pass zap to each, nothing happens.<br/>
&quot;when all else fails, read the docs!&quot;<br/>
</p></aside></section>
</section><section><img data-src="images/09-44-53.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Let&#x27;s check the documentation for the &quot;each&quot; function.<br/>
API means application programming interface, a set of &quot;contracts&quot;<br/>
defining what inputs each function expects, and what functionality it provides.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><section>skipping: function with inputs<aside class="notes"><p>arrow down to see skipped slides</p></aside></section><section><img data-src="images/09-45-08.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
[function with inputs]<br/>
we see that each() expects that function to take two inputs,<br/>
and it expects the 2nd input to be the element to act on,<br/>
unlike our zap function, which acts on its first and only element.<br/>
JQuery calls our function once for each box, but passes the element as the 2nd input.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/09-46-57.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
[function with inputs]<br/>
so let&#x27;s just insert an input before the element so element<br/>
will be the 2nd input...and it works!<br/>
</p></aside></section>
</section><section><img data-src="images/09-46-59.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
We see that javascript sets an implicit input called &quot;this&quot; in any object&#x27;s function, and jQuery sets &quot;this&quot; to be the focal element.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-each1.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
So our function needs no inputs...<br/>
...and that works.<br/>
Our code here is sandwiched, called _by_ the each function [once for each matching element] and calling _into_ the css function,<br/>
part of a &quot;call stack&quot;, as we saw in the multi-layer error message earlier.<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-each2.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
But javascript is about more than just mimicking CSS, it lets us define how the page behaves in response to user actions, called events.  Here&#x27;s where jQuery really shines.<br/>
We can add an &quot;event handler&quot; for the click event to each of the matching elements, and it has the exact same API as each() does!<br/>
Now clicking on the boxes [maybe does nothing depending on the state, so set alpha as needed] changes the background.<br/>
But it would be really cool if we could go in both directions without changing the code... [maybe leave the mouse inside one of the colored boxes, but not critical]<br/>
</p></aside></section>
<section><img data-src="images/slide-each3.png">
<aside class="notes"><p>
Which we can by adding handlers for the mouseenter and mouseleave events.<br/>
And since javascript is an imperative language,<br/>
whichever runs last applies.<br/>
