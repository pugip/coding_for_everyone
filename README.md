How inclusive can coding become?  Here we seek to present front-end coding to a general audience,
using the familiar browser, yet:
- hammer home critical software concepts like modularity and functions;
- show the ugly code behind real web pages, and how to find the code you want to tweak;
- even show error messages and begin to decode their meaning;

all on the way to making a real web page more readable and attractive.
